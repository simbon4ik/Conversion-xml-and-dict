#xml -> dict
#dict -> xml

This is a small project with a simple interface menu, which is created for convert a record from a dictionary (word, meaning, emphasis) to an xml string format and back.

You can use this in your projects, as well as suggest options for improving/changing some functions, I will be glad to receive any feedback.

In addition, if you find errors or other problems in the code, please also report. Enjoy using it!
